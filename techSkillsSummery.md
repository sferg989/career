## Cover Letter

### Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited about the opportunity to join your team. I'm seeking an engineering leadership role within a company driven by strong core values, where I can leverage my diverse experiences to drive impactful results.

My career journey has been anything but traditional, shaping my ability to solve complex problems and adapt to diverse challenges. I hold a Master's in Music Performance and an MBA in Finance. I began my career in the finance department of a large aerospace and defense company, where I first started programming‚Äîwriting PHP to automate tasks and eliminate wasted time. Next, I managed a 4,000-acre rice farm for four years. After that, I fully transitioned into technology, working my way up to Tech Lead in Software Engineering. This unique path has honed my leadership, strategic thinking, and technical expertise.

In my current role, I split my time between leading teams and addressing complex technical challenges. I've successfully revamped hiring processes, implemented career roadmaps, and supported team members' growth while actively participating in Scrum ceremonies like standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.

My day-to-day technical expertise includes Next.js, Astro, and Remix. I have really enjoyed building Cloudflare Workers, TypeScript libraries, CI/CD pipelines, and DevOps tools like Docker and Terraform.

I look forward to bringing my leadership, technical skills, and diverse perspective to your team.

### Recent Projects I've Enjoyed:

- **CLI Tool** - Allows developers to quickly create new TypeScript libraries, Cloudflare Workers, and web components
- **Legacy App Modernization** - Modernizing legacy applications to Next.js
- **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automating coding standards and deployment processes
- **Headless E-commerce** - WooGraphQL e-commerce site implementation
- **Quality Assurance** - Checkout smoke tests and automated testing

Best regards,  
Steve Ferguson
